Android application to manage your growing tent.

This android application is the solution for automating and getting real time stats on your growing tent, such as current temperature and humidity.

It works by gathering the information sent from a raspberry pi with a DHT11 sensor to get the humidity and temperature values.

Features completed:
* Display current temperature and humidity of the tent in real time. If there is any change, it will be reflected in the screen without requiring any user input.


Features to be developped:
* User settings module to know which are the expected values of humidity and temperature.
* Notifications received when the values are above or beyond the specified threshold.
* Remote control of the tent, to let the user turn on/off the lights, control the humifier, the fans and extractor.
* Wattering schedule
* Wattering automation
